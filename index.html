        <p>If you're here, it's either because you're grading my assignment, checking out my github portfolio, or you could just be passing time. Either way is fine with me. Now, if you're still here with me you are probably wondering who I am...don't worry,
            soon enough we will get to the bottom of that. In the meantime, the important thing to know here is that I am an aspiring front end/ full stack developer/ problem solver/ detective/ funny/ okay okay, I'm getting carried away. Let me start
            from the begining.</p>
        <p>Picture it...Circa 1986, a young curious star was born. Okay, that was way too far back. Fast forward to 2009 really trying to enter the workforce and not having a clue what to do or even what I was really good at. I'd studied Medical Coding and
            Billing and gotten a certificate of completion. I'd done some basic college classes always knowing that I really enjoyed computer science but not having enough patience to finish a degree program(at least at that time. Hey, you know how the
            younger years go.. ). Over the course of the years, I tried many college courses. I tried many different job fields from sales to banking to collections. You name it, I've probably done it and got little satisfaction from it or got bored with
            it.
        </p>
        <p>Enter: Corona Virus. Corona virus came in and shut the world down and here I was with no control of whether I could keep my job or not and it was really bothersome. So I clicked on a Facebook ad for a cyber security bootcamp, talked to a career
            counselor and poof! I had a magical idea to go into cyber security (which my sister had been pushing me to do forever). I started researching all my career options and choices and I kept seeing coding and developer and looked into those also
            and well, the rest is history.</p>
        <p>The self taught developer road is long and windy and has lots of turns and twists and not a lot of guidance. That said, I had my work cut out for me in a major way. Here I was immersed in information, buying courses and books and pretty much reading
            anything I could get my hands on. Thanks to Twitter I ended up with an amazing mentor that helped me start some projects of my own. One day while I was at work, a young lady came into my location with a Coder Girl shirt on. I had already tested
            into a different bootcamp as a Java developer. I figured it couldn't hurt to look into Coder girl and at least see what they had to offer. I read the info, found out the program was free, tested in and here we are today I put my first page
            together and guess what? I know JAVASCRIPT!!!</p>
        <p>Whew!! If you're still with me, I applaud you for being a great reader lol I'll throw some pictures or something in here to make it worth your while for sticking it out with me!!

        </p>
